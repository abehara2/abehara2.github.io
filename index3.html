                            For a class I took during the Spring 2019 semester, the final project required students to redesign a common household item 
                            for increased assembly efficiency and recyclability. The class is titled ME 270 and I chose to redesign a mechanical pencil.</br></br>

                            For each of the parts of the original assembly, I asked the three primary DFA questions regarding each component. </br></br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Does the part move simultaneously with another part? </br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Is the part of a different material, or isolated form, all the other parts already assembled? </br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Can the manufacturing method and tolerance be the same for these parts? </br></br>

                            After answering these questions, only three of the parts are essential and the other three can be combined or 
                            eliminated entirely from the product. This leaves a theoretical minimum of 3 parts on the assembly.</br></br>

                                If the DFA index is less than the 20% to 25% range, the assembly is in dire need of a redesign. 
                                40.1785% is above this range and although a redesign is unnecessary, it would be a good idea to 
                                redesign in order to improve the efficiency further. </br></br>

                                <div style="text-align: center;"><h7><b> Redesign Concepts </b></h7> </br> </br></div>
                                As for the redesign, there is not a lot of room for improvement for this product's functionality or 
                                recyclability. There is a possibility to merge the pencil body (#5 on Eng. Drawing) and the lead container 
                                (#4 on Eng. Drawing) which would not reduce the amount of material being used or the cost of the product. 
                                There is also some complication to this as the mechanism to dispense the graphite is built into the lead 
                                container, but at a glance this seems like a possible idea. A very feasible redesign that would help 
                                recyclability would be to combine the pencil body and the pencil tip (#1 on Eng. Drawing). The pencil
                                 tip is a metal screw-on and is separate only for the aesthetic and provides no real benefit to the 
                                 rigidity, cost, or recyclability of the product.  In fact, replacing the metal tip with plastic will
                                  increase the reprocess-ability of the product. The last idea to improve this product would be to get r
                                  id of the gel grips. Gel grips have recently started to be manufactured using thermoplastic elastomers, 
                                  the most common of these being polyphenylene ether. These thermoplastics are well known for their 
                                  reprocess-ability and provide many ecological benefits to other rubbers. Eliminating this grip 
                                  does not benefit the recyclability of the product, but it will help to drive down the cost of the 
                                  pencil. If all of these changes are implemented, there is a theoretical minimum of three parts. 
                                  However, two of the changes provide little to no benefit for the recyclability of the product so 
                                  it would be ideal to cut the assembly down to five parts by combining the pencil tip 
                                  and pencil body. </br></br>

                                  Depicted above is a Pugh Matrix outlining the three redesign possibilities that could be implemented on a 
                                  newer version of the product. According to this diagram, the only suggestion that would increase 
                                  recyclability, let alone cost and rigidity, would be, as discussed before, to merge the pencil 
                                  body and tip. Combining both the tip and the body would eliminate an extra material being used in
                                   fabrication which would aid reprocessability. <br><br>

                                   Depicted below is an outline drawing that has the assembled view and exploded view showing that the
                                    redesigned pencil body indeed fits with the other parts from the original product. The pencil grip 
                                    in the exploded view is still attached to the pencil body.<br><br>

                                    The hypothetical main problem with this redesign is that for every 40 clicks to dispense lead out of
                                     the pencil, the lead jams twice. The variables that affect the dispensing of the lead are the dispensing 
                                     force and the coefficient of friction of the polypropylene that was injection molded to form the part.<br><br>

                                    For this process, I decided that a 2  factorial design would need to be performed meaning that the two 
                                    variables discussed above will be examined on a low level (-1) and a high level (+1). This factorial 
                                    design contains 4 unique testing conditions that are necessary in order to collect all data possible.
                                     The first table shows the design variables with their low and high levels and the second table shows 
                                     the tests. <br><br>

                                     <img src="doeone.png" style="width: 100%;"></img> <br><br>


                                    From this data we see that there are 2 valuable comparisons that can tell us how the jamming varies according to 
                                    the coefficient of friction and 2 valuable comparisons that we can use to tell us how the force of dispensing 
                                    affects jamming. For the coefficient of friction I can use the  horizontal line segments that signify
                                     Test 1-2 and Test 3-4 and for the force of dispensing I can use the vertical lines that signify Test 1-3 and Test 2-4.<br><br>

                                     From this data we can see that as coefficient of friction increases, the number of jams increases as the evaluated equation yields a
                                      positive number. On the other hand, as force of dispensing increases, the number of jams decreases as denoted by the negative value. <br><br>

                                      From calculating the variance and standard deviation we can then find the significant effects and sigma significance. The 2 sigma 
                                      significance is found by multiplying the average standard deviation by 2 and the significant values are 
                                      found through sum product calculations like those done previously. The 2 sigma significance is useful 
                                      because any values that are greater than this are considered significant. <br><br>

                                      After looking at the data, it was deemed that only the coefficient of friction had a significant effect on the performance
                                       on the lead dispensing mechanism. In order to enact this change in the design, it would be better to use 
                                       HDPE instead of polypropylene for the redesigned pencil body and cap because it has a significantly 
                                       lower static coefficient of 0.100. This design change mildly affects the reprocessability of the pencil 
                                       because it is a different material, but does not affect its recyclability.<br><br>

                                        Overall the redesign of the product seemed successful. The DFA efficiency rose by 29.0523%, 
                                        total costs decreased by $0.40, and total investment costs decreased as well. As for function
                                         of the product, the function seems to be close to the same. This is good because the product,
                                          pre-redesign, was fully functional. The small fix the redesign did make was when fidgeting with 
                                          the pencil, the cap would sometimes fall off, but because the cap and body are now one piece, 
                                          this is no longer an issue. In conclusion, the redesign improved cost, functionality, and kept 
                                          the quality of the product around the same, if not better.

                                My product is a therapeutic cane that resists tremors from those with muscle degenerative diseases, 
                                specifically Parkinson’s, that helps increases stability, safety, and independence of its user.​​ The idea for targeting 
                                people with Parkinson’s and other muscle-degenerative diseases came from knowing those who have suffered. My grandfather
                                 has been to the hospital for falling due to his tremors causing him to alter the position of his cane. After seeing my grandfather
                                  go through these scary and severe falls, it occurred to me that many other people with similar conditions may go through experiences like these. 
                                  After assessing a target group and the problem I wanted to fix, I came up with the idea to create a cane that resists the forces of tremors to 
                                  prevent unnecessary falls.</br></br>
